    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "When testing complex REDCap scripts or functionalities, it is **essential** that one tests them in the Test project first before running/using them on the Target project.\n",
    "Thus, there needs to be a way to make the Test project function just like the Target project.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook exports data from the Target project, then import them into the Test project. The Test project then will have the exact same records as the Target project, effectively making them the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **This notebook will wipe out all existing data from the Test project before the import. The existing data will still be recoverable through a JSON file, which can later be reimported back.** \n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions\n",
    "Currently, the API does not allow for importing instruments. Importing instruments has to be done manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download all instrument zips from Target project.\n",
    "2. Download current Test project's instrument zips if not relevant to Target project.\n",
    "3. Delete current instruments from Test project.\n",
    "4. Import the Target project's instrument zips into Test project.\n",
    "5. Configure repeating instruments if needed.\n",
    "6. Run this notebook.\n",
